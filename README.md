# About
This service is a good fit for those who want to discuss/explain something with/to a teammate and need to draw it. In general, it's designed for competitive programming. Now it looks like a piece of shit, but i hope i'll improve it. I think you really don't need it now (it's pretty useless).

# How to run (in case you are a masochist. it's really shit. I recommend you stay away from this app)

First of all, you need to install node.js. You can easily google how to do it.
Then run server.js. You can do it from cmd:

	> node path_to_server.js <

After this, you have a node.js server running. Now you can open public/index.html
DONE!
