# About
This service is a good fit for those who want to discuss/explain something with/to a teammate and need to draw it. Now it looks like a piece of shit, but i hope i'll improve it.

# How to run

First of all, you need to install node.js. You can easily google how to do it.
Then run server.js. You can do it from cmd:

	> node path_to_server.js <

After this, you have a node.js server running. Now you can open public/index.html
DONE!
